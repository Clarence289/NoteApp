React Native Note App with Firebase Integration
This is a simple note-taking mobile application built using React Native and Firebase. The app allows users to add, view, and delete notes. Firebase is used as the backend to store and retrieve notes.

Features
Add Note: Users can add a new note by providing a title and the note content.

List Notes: All added notes are displayed in a visually appealing card layout with the title, note content, and timestamp.

Remove Note: Users can delete a note, and the app provides feedback on the success or failure of the removal.

Validation: The app includes basic input validation for the note title and content.

Technology Stack
React Native: The app is developed using the React Native framework, allowing for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android).

Firebase: Firebase is utilized for the backend, providing real-time data storage and authentication.

React Navigation: The navigation between screens is managed using the React Navigation library.

Firebase Firestore: Firestore is used as the NoSQL database for storing notes.

Firebase Authentication: While not implemented in the provided code, Firebase Authentication can be added for user authentication and security.

Project Structure
Components: The AddNoteScreen, NoteScreen, and Home components handle different aspects of the application's UI.

Firebase Configuration: The Firebase configuration is stored in the config/firebase.js file.

Firebase Service: Functions to interact with Firebase, such as saving and fetching notes, are in the service/firebaseService.js file.

Styles: The styles folder contains the styling configurations for different components.

TestingFetch Component: A separate component (TestingFetch.js) demonstrates fetching data from Firebase using a custom hook (useFetch.js).
